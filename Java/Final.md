# Final:

the `final` keyword is used with `variables`, `method` and `classes`.

---

## Final var:

with any variable it makes them a constant where the assignment is allowed only on initialization of the value.

```java
final double PI = 3.1456;
```

---

## Final classes:

a class with final can't be inherited from, so no class can extend it.

---

## Final Method:

a final method can't be overwritten
