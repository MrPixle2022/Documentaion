# Setup

to create a spring boot project use the spring initializer either by going to `https://start.spring.io/` or using the one in intellij or vscode, you will be asked about:

- build tool: maven - gradle
- language: java , kotlin, groovy
- spring version
- group: the organization -reverse domain e.g. com.company-
- artifact: the name used for the project/.jar file
- name: display name of the project
- description: the description of the project
- package name: the root java package
- packaging: jar or war
- java version
- start dependencies -usually include spring web-

using the site will generate a `.zip` file which you extract the project from.
