# Metadata

next js gives a lot fo care to `SEO`, by using the `metadata` you can improve your app's `CEO`.

the main layout of the app contains the metadata that by default is used for the entire app, **since there are none other**.

to create a layout(can be in server components & layouts)

```typescript
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "NextJs Full Tutorial", // the page title
  description: "Generated by Mr_Pxl", // the description
  applicationName: "the best tutorial", // the name of the application
  authors: [{ name: "Mr_Pxl" }],// the author
  creator: "Mr_Pxl", // this is the name of the creator
};
```

you don't have to fill all.

if your page is dynamic & you want to create dynamic metadata for it use the `generateMetadata` method.

```typescript
export async function generateMetadata( {params} : ProfileIdProps): Promise<Metadata> {
  return {title: `hello user with id ${params.id?? "(you don't have one)"}`}
}
```
