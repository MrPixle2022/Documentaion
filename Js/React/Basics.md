# Creating a Project:

---

to create a react project use:

```powershell
npx create-react-app appname
```

or install create-react-app-offline:

```powershell
npm i -g create-react-app-offline
```

then use:

```powershell
npx crao -n appname
```

>[!NOTE]
> the react app will auto initialize a git repo

after waiting for the files to be downloaded use:

```powershell
cd appname
```



---

# Files and server

use:
```powershell
npm start
```

to start the test server, few seconds later and you will see this:
![react](Imgs/ReactBase.png)

---


![Files](Imgs/FilesBase.png) 

in vscode you will have these files:

mostly you won't need most of theses so you can delete all files in src except
``App.js``
``index.js``
and make sure to remove any import from the old files that have been removed 

---

after doing that you will have:

![After delete](Imgs/AfterDeletFiles.png)
