---

forms in react work a little diffrent from html forms as they require ``hooks`` to work and function for example:


![Example](Imgs/FORMSEXAMPLE01.png)

the ``onSubmit`` is an event that fires when the form is submitted

``preventDefault`` method on the ``e`` (the event object) prevenets the default behaviour of the onSubmit event (the page refresh)

``onChange`` event that fires on the input when it's value (input give) changes
