# Active Class:

the `router-link` component has an `active-class` prop that can be used to define the class of the active link.

```html
<router-link
	to="/path"
	active-class="active">
	<!-- content -->
</router-link>
```

so in the example above, the `active` class will be added to the `router-link` when the `to` path is active.
