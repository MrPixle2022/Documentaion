# Inheritance:

in css inheritance is when a property is set on the parent and is passed down to the children, by default text properties are the ones passed from parent to children, keep in mind that those automatically inherited have a very low specificity.

> [!TIP] for global text related styles, set them on the body so that they are applied to all children's text

you can set a property to inherit it's parent's value by using the value of `inherit`
