## font-family:

the `font-family` allows you to set the font family for the text. it takes an array of font family names. the `first` is the main font and the rest are `fallbacks`.

```css
div {
	background-color: gray;
	color: white;
	font-family: monospace, sans-serif, "Times New Roman";
}
```

> [!NOTE] that the `Times New Roman` is put between `""` because of the space within it.
