# Configure the user:

git won't permit you to commit any thing unless you configure it to know who you are.

by using:

```bash
git config user.name --global "name"
#and
git config user.email --global "email"
```

you define the username & email attached to any change you commit.

later on if you which to see these values remove the value & the `global` flag -optionally-.
