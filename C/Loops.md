# Loops:

---

## While loop:

```c
while(condition){
    doSomeThing();
}
```

---

## DoWhile:

```c
do{
    doSomething()
}while(condition);
```

> [!NOTE]
> the block is executed at least once even in the condition is false

---

## For:

```c
for(initialization; condition; step){
    //do something
}
```

## Break & Continue:

`break` is used to force the loop to stop, while `continue` forces the loop to jump to the next one
